# StellaRAT

A Remote Access Trojan(RAT) made from C# Completly, this simple(Unfinished) RAT currently only has the function to To create A PowerShell BackDoor but what is great about this tool is that it is stable and Super Fast Because of How it was written and how basic it is.
one of the downsides though is that it is only single client based...


# To Do

- [ ] - Add "Fun" Fetures, like jump scaring and Trolling options.

- [ ] - Make it MuiltiClient so they it can take more than 1 Client/Connection

- [ ] - Surveillance, like viewing Camera Remote Desktop and Keylogging

- [ ] - Crypto Mining EG, Bitcoin, Monero and ETH

- [ ] - Password Recovery and Cookie/Session Stealing.
